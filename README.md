# Project Omnilyth

> *"One tool to rule them all, one tool to find them, one tool to bring them all, and in the darkness... calculate their chromatic costs."*

---

**Project Omnilyth** is an evolving, all-in-one toolkit for Path of Exile — built for exiles who are tired of having 47 browser tabs open just to play a game.

We're combining crafting calculators, atlas tools, economy utilities, and more into a single, unified dark-mode interface. Because spreadsheets are for accountants, not gamers. *(No offense to accountants who also play PoE — we know you exist.)*

## What's Live

- **Chromatic Calculator** — Vorici bench vs raw chromes, Jeweller's Method comparison
- **Tainted Chromatic** — For when you've already bricked your item and need to cope
- **Omen of Blanching** — White socket probability with cost breakdowns
- **Jeweller's Method** — The crafting bench socket trick most people learn about too late
- **Fusing Calculator** — How many fusings until 6-link? Spoiler: more than you think
- **Socket Calculator** — Jeweller's Orb math so you don't waste 300 on a 4-socket
- **Map Mod Regex Generator** — Because typing regex by hand is a war crime

## What's Coming

We have... *plans*. Big plans. The kind of plans that make you whisper "no way" at 3 AM.

Stay tuned. Or don't. We'll be here either way, calculating.

## Tech

React + Tailwind CSS 4 + Vite. Dark theme only — we're not animals.

Live prices from [poe.ninja](https://poe.ninja). Shoutout to the real MVP.

## Credits

Originally built on [Siveran's chromatic calculator](https://github.com/Siveran/siveran.github.io). Extended and evolved by [EtherealCarnivore](https://github.com/EtherealCarnivore) into something... more.

*If this tool saved you even one Exalted Orb worth of bad crafting decisions, it was worth it.*

*If it didn't — skill issue.* 😤
